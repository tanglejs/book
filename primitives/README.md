# Primitives

## What is a Primitive?

A primitive is a single unit of general-purpose functionality, similar to a
module. The key difference is that a primitive is not implemented directly, but
rather provides objects to be extended by modules and overloaded to change their
behavior.

A primitive does not have a configuration scope.
