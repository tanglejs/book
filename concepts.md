## Overview

The Tangle ecosystem is organized into **plugins**. Plugins provide
functionality for working with **projects**. A project is a directory that
houses one or more **apps**. An app runs in a browser and is composed out of
**modules**. A module implements a set of related features and may contain
**submodules**. Modules and submodules may derive generic funtionality by
extending from **primitives**.
