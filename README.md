# Introduction

> Tangle itself, as well as this document, are still in early development and
  you should expect to find many errors, bugs and inaccuracies during this time
  leading up to the `v1.0` release.

## What is Tangle?

Tangle is a modular structure for
[Backbone.Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) applications, and a set of tools
for working with those projects.

If you've been cobbling together a frontend toolchain from assorted
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generators and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) tasks,
then you understand how time-consuming it can be to get all the pieces in
place - and you may be missing out on best practices that could benefit your
application.

When you build your frontend using Tangle, you get...

* A standard **file structure** for all your frontends. Add
[shortcuts to your editor](/editor.html) to quickly jump around your frontend.

* Every feature you build can be reused in your next project. Your apps
  are entirely **composed from reusable modules** with independent documentation
  and tests.

* **Generators for everything.** Quickly scaffold out new apps, modules, primitives,
  and plugins to expand your toolbox.

* Generated **documentation** and **style guides**.

* Smart **[configuration](/configuration.html)** and **[environments](/projects/environments.html)**.

* Intelligent **LiveReload**, RequireJS **optimization**, **source maps**, and more.

* Automatic **test runners** and **code quality**.

* Smart tools for **[refactoring](/refactoring.html)**, **introspection**, **debugging**,
  **logging**, and **stats**.
