# Installation

The Tangle tools are intended to run on any UNIX-like development machines that
has [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) available.

You do not need to install anything to your webserver. Tangle is for developing
frontends, which can be hosted like a static website, served by whatever
backend you already use, or even embedded in a desktop or mobile application.

## Installing Tangle core

Use npm to install the latest [tangle](https://www.npmjs.org/package/tangle)
module globally.

    $ npm install -g tangle
